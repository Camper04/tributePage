            <h2>History</h2>
            <h3>Phantom Blood (1888-1889)</h3>

            <p>Speedwagon first appears as an Ogre Street thug boss attacking Jonathan Joestar, but soon realized the
                young man's worthiness and dedication, and becomes his good friend. He helps to uncover Dio Brando's
                plot to assassinate George Joestar and from that point onward remained by Jonathan's side, helping in
                whatever way he could to defeat Dio.</p>

            <p>According to Will Anthonio Zeppeli, Speedwagon could never master the art of hamon,
                a fact that greatly distressed Speedwagon, though Zeppeli pushed the pressure point in Speedwagon's
                midsection anyway to give him the ability to harness "small ripples".</p>

            <p>Though Speedwagon can hold his own
                in a fight, as initially demonstrated during his fight against Jonathan when he used his hat with a
                hidden buzz-saw, he mostly sits back and remains on the sidelines, as he is not a hamon user and cannot
                fight as well against zombies and vampires. He does, however, offer words of encouragement through the
                entire adventure. After Zeppeli's death, he takes on wearing his hat as a remembrance of their fallen
                ally.</p>

            <h3>Battle Tendency (1938-1939)</h3>

            <p>Speedwagon had traveled to America sometime in between the events of Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency,
                where he would discover oil and form the powerful Speedwagon Foundation. His team would discover the
                pillar man Santana, but during that discovery, Straizo would betray them and turn into a vampire
                himself, killing several researchers whose blood would awaken Santana.</p>

            <p> Speedwagon would have died from
                his wounds if it had not been for his rescue by Rudol von Stroheim, a Nazi general conducting
                experiments with the Stone Mask and Santana. After Joseph defeats Santana, Speedwagon spends most of the
                story accompanying Erina and Smokey, while withholding information about the Pillar Men from them at
                Joseph's request.</p>

            <h3>Legacy</h3>

            <p>Speedwagon dies of a heart attack at the age of 89. Even after his death, he would dedicate the
                Speedwagon Foundation to biochemical science and technology and use it to help the Joestar family
                throughout Parts 3-6. His men would go on to help Jotaro destroy the remains of Dio and create the
                prosthetic hand for Joseph Joestar, as well as study the Stand-creating Arrow, analyze Giorno Giovanna's
                Joestar bloodline, and maintain Jotaro's health after his Stand Discs are stolen by Whitesnake.</p>
